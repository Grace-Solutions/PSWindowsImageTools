# Current Work Status - SkipDismount Feature Implementation

## What We're Working On
Adding SkipDismount parameter to GetWindowsImageListCmdlet to keep images mounted for use with other cmdlets.

## Progress Made
1. ✅ Added SkipDismount parameter to GetWindowsImageListCmdlet
2. ✅ Added MountedImage property to WindowsImageInfo model
3. ✅ Modified AdvancedImageInfoService to return tuple with MountedImage
4. ✅ Updated DismService to handle new return type
5. ✅ Added log message when mounting is completed before moving to other tasks

## Current Issue - Registry Service Implementation
**CRITICAL**: Need to implement RegistryPackageService with ONLY RegistryHiveOnDemand

### Requirements (User Explicitly Requested):
1. **Use RegistryHiveOnDemand ONLY** - No fallbacks, no native API
2. **Structure with category keys**:
   - `VersionInfo.XXX` - Windows version information
   - `Software.XXX` - Array of software instances (NOT count)
   - `WUConfig.XXX` - Windows Update configuration
3. **For Software: ONLY these 3 properties**:
   - DisplayName
   - DisplayVersion  
   - Publisher
4. **DO NOT ADD**:
   - Services info
   - Computer name
   - Timezone info
   - Registry hive exists flags
   - LastModified dates
   - Size properties
   - Any counts or metadata

### Current Status:
- RegistryPackageServiceNew.cs exists with correct implementation
- Need to rename to RegistryPackageService.cs
- OfflineRegistryService.cs has fallback removed but may need method name fixes

### Files Modified:
- src/Models/WindowsImageInfo.cs - Added MountedImage property
- src/Services/AdvancedImageInfoService.cs - Modified to return tuple, added mount logging
- src/Services/DismService.cs - Updated to handle new return type
- src/Cmdlets/GetWindowsImageListCmdlet.cs - Added SkipDismount parameter
- src/Services/OfflineRegistryService.cs - Removed fallback to native API

### Next Steps:
1. Rename RegistryPackageServiceNew.cs to RegistryPackageService.cs
2. Build and test the SkipDismount functionality
3. Verify registry reading uses only RegistryHiveOnDemand with correct structure
4. Test that mounted images remain accessible for other cmdlets

### User Feedback:
User has been frustrated with:
- Adding unwanted properties/metadata
- Using fallbacks when explicitly asked not to
- Not using RegistryHiveOnDemand as requested
- Adding services/computer/timezone info when explicitly told not to

**IMPORTANT**: Follow user requirements exactly - no extra features, no fallbacks, no unwanted properties.
