Write-Host "â€¢ Extracted exact P/Invoke signatures from Microsoft's implementation" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Identified all native API functions and structures" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "NATIVE API IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETED:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "   â€¢ Proper marshaling for Unicode strings and callbacks" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   â€¢ Memory management helpers" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SERVICES:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "â€¢ Updated DismService.cs to use WimExportService for export operations" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Maintains compatibility with existing cmdlets" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Provides fallback to Microsoft.Dism for basic operations" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "â€¢ Export uses WIM API (wimgapi.dll) - same as Microsoft" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Mount/Package/Feature operations use DISM API (dismapi.dll)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ No shell-out to dism.exe - pure native API calls" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Progress callbacks implemented exactly like Microsoft" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "â€¢ Proper resource management with IDisposable pattern" -ForegroundColor White
